      <p
        >It does automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable
        information when you visit the Service. This information is called

        This includes information about your activity (such as how you use our
        services, how you interact with others using our services, and the

        striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But
        remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of
        electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee
        its absolute security.

        knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children
        under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me
